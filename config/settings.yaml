  # Surface water caveat text
  surface_water_caveat: |
    Surface water flooding is not included in this indicator. The Environment Agency
    does not operate a surface water flood warning system due to the sporadic and
    unpredictable nature of surface water flooding from intense rainfall. Surface water
    flooding affects more properties nationally (3.4 million) than river and coastal
    flooding combined (2.7 million). Where available, Section 19 flood investigation
    reports from Lead Local Flood Authorities provide local records of significant
    surface water flooding events.
